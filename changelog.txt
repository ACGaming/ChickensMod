Main improvements:
* DNA!!! Chickens have stats which makes breeding even more fun.
** With higher 'growth' stat, time to lay an egg is decreased, chicken grows faster and they reproduce sooner.
** 'Gain' will double or even triple the production!
** Higher 'strength' gives better change for genes to affect child stats.
* Liquid eggs can be 'pumped' into tanks, e.g. imagine smeltery fueled by Chickens!
* Spawn rate can be fully configured. Nether spawn rate can be manually reduced/increased.

Minor improvements/fixes:
* German translation added.
* Approximate lay progress in WAILA.
